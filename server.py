    This shows an example of a post request, one of the types of http message.
    This allows a client to send information inside the payload part of the http
    packet, and the server can read that information in the form of the dictionary
    `request.form`.
    You can also do similar with GET requests, although the dictionary
    will then be `request.args`. Additionally, the data will be directly in the url,
    so you likely want to avoid GET if sending sensitive information such as passwords
    as we are in this assignment.
